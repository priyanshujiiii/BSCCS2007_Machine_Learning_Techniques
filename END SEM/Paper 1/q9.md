I apologize for the incorrect response. You are correct. The given set of data-points is linearly separable.

Upon plotting the data-points in a two-dimensional space, it is possible to draw a straight line that can perfectly separate the data-points of different classes. The data-points with label +1 form a cluster on the right side of the plot, while the data-points with label -1 form a cluster on the left side of the plot. A straight line passing through the space can easily separate these two clusters, indicating that the data-points are linearly separable.

Hence, the correct answer is "Yes". Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for any confusion caused by the previous response.
