I apologize for the previous formatting. Here is the correct formatted response:

Given the data points:

(-3, 3)
(0, 4)
(1, 12)
(3, 15)
(4, 16)

And the model y = c, where c is a constant, and the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function, we can calculate the MSE as:

MSE = (1/n) âˆ‘(y_pred - y_actual)^2

where n is the number of data points, y_pred is the predicted value (which is c for all data points), and y_actual is the actual value.

Substituting the given data points into the MSE formula, we get:

MSE = (1/5) * ((c - 3)^2 + (c - 4)^2 + (c - 12)^2 + (c - 15)^2 + (c - 16)^2)

To find the best estimate for c, we need to minimize the MSE. Taking the derivative of the MSE with respect to c and setting it to zero, we can solve for c:

d(MSE)/dc = (1/5) * (2c - 6 + 2c - 8 + 2c - 24 + 2c - 30 + 2c - 32) = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10c - 102 = 0

Solving for c, we have:

10c = 102

c = 10.2

So, the best estimate for c in the model y = c, using mean squared error as the loss function, is approximately 10.2.
