Sure! Here is the reformatted solution:

Given:
- Optimal weight vector: w = [2, -1]T
- Unit square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)

To calculate the probability that a randomly picked point from the unit square is predicted as belonging to class +1 by the SVM:

1. Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the points (0,0), (1,0), and (0.5,1) using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   Area = 0.5 * |x1*(y2-y3) + x2*(y3-y1) + x3*(y1-y2)|
   Plugging in the coordinates of the vertices:
   Area = 0.5 * |0*(0-1) + 1*(1-0) + 0.5*(0-1)|
   Area = 0.5 * |0 + 1 + (-0.5)|
   Area = 0.75

2. Calculate the area of the unit square, which is 1 * 1 = 1.

3. Calculate the probability:
   Probability = Area of Triangle / Area of Unit Square
   Probability = 0.75 / 1
   Probability = 0.75 or 75%

So, the probability that a randomly picked point from the unit square is predicted as belonging to class +1 by the SVM is 0.75 or 75%.
