The correct answer is:

Both (1) and (2) are true

Explanation:

1. Every support vector lies on one of the two supporting hyperplanes: This statement is true because support vectors are the data-points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) and have non-zero slack variables in a hard-margin SVM. These support vectors determine the position and orientation of the hyperplanes that define the margin, and they are located on or within the margin region, which are the supporting hyperplanes.

2. Every point on one of the two supporting hyperplanes is a support vector: This statement is also true because the supporting hyperplanes are defined by the support vectors. Any data-point that lies on the supporting hyperplanes is a support vector because it contributes to defining the position and orientation of the hyperplanes and plays a crucial role in the SVM's decision-making process.

Therefore, both statements (1) and (2) are true, and the correct answer is "Both (1) and (2) are true".
