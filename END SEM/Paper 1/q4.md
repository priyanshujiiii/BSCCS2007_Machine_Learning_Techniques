Sure! Here is the reformatted answer:

As the number of data-points, n, becomes very large in the MNIST digit classification problem with 10 classes, the accuracy of the dummy classifier that randomly picks one of the 10 classes as its prediction for each input data-point will converge to the probability of picking the correct class, which is 1/10.

Therefore, the accuracy of the dummy classifier as n becomes very large is 1/10 or 0.1, which is equivalent to 10%.
