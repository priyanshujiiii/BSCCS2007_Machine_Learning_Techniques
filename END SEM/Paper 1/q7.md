The correct answer is:

0° < θ < 180°

Explanation:

In logistic regression, the decision boundary is determined by the weight vector w and the feature vectors x. The predicted class for a given feature vector x is determined by the sign of the dot product w⋅x, where w is the weight vector and ⋅ denotes the dot product.

In this case, we are given two feature vectors:
x1 = [1, 3]
x2 = [-1, 3]

The weight vector w makes an angle θ with the positive x1 axis (horizontal axis). For both x1 and x2 to be predicted as class-1, the dot product w⋅x1 and w⋅x2 should be positive, i.e., w⋅x1 > 0 and w⋅x2 > 0.

Since x1 has a positive value for x1 and x2 has a negative value for x1, the only way to ensure that both x1 and x2 are predicted as class-1 is to have the weight vector w making an angle θ between 0° and 180° with the positive x1 axis. This is because the dot product w⋅x will be positive for both x1 and x2 if θ is between 0° and 180°, which corresponds to the range of 0° < θ < 180°. Therefore, the correct answer is 0° < θ < 180°.
