The most appropriate option is:

The network 
�
2
N 
2
​
 will be able to learn somewhat useful patterns from 
�
2
D 
2
​
 . But the performance of 
�
1
N 
1
​
 on 
�
1
D 
1
​
 will be much better than 
�
2
N 
2
​
 on 
�
2
D 
2
​
 .

Explanation:

When the images are turned upside down in both the training and test dataset to create 
�
2
D 
2
​
, the network 
�
2
N 
2
​
 with the same architecture as the original network trained on 
�
1
D 
1
​
 will still be able to learn some useful patterns from the modified dataset. However, its performance on 
�
2
D 
2
​
 will not be as good as the original network's performance on 
�
1
D 
1
​
. This is because the network 
�
2
N 
2
​
 will need to adjust to the new orientation of the images, and the upside-down images may not contain the same patterns and features as the original images.

In summary, while the network 
�
2
N 
2
​
 can still learn somewhat useful patterns from 
�
2
D 
2
​
, its performance on 
�
2
D 
2
​
 will likely be inferior to the performance of 
�
1
N 
1
​
 on 
�
1
D 
1
​
 due to the differences in image orientation between the two datasets.
