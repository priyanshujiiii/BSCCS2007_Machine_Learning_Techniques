I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify the calculation.

Given that the logistic regression model is equally confident about its prediction for x1 and x2, we can assume that the distances of x1 and x2 from the decision boundary are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let's denote the distance of x1 from the decision boundary as d1, and the distance of x2 from the decision boundary as d2. Since the logistic regression model is as confident about its prediction for x1 as it is for x2, we can assume that d1 = -d2.

The ratio of the distances (absolute values) of x2 and x1 from the decision boundary can be calculated as:

Ratio = |d2| / |d1| = |d2| / |-d2| = 1

Therefore, the correct answer is 1. The ratio of the distances (absolute values) of x2 and x1 from the decision boundary is 1.
