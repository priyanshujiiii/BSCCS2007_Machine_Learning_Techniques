Sure, here's the reformatted answer:

The value of the unknown quantity u can be determined from the equation of the decision boundary: 
wT x - u = 0. 
If we substitute the given value of σ(θT x) = 1/(1 + e^(-θT x)) into the equation, we get: 
(1/(1 + e^(-θT x))) - u = 0. 
Solving for u, we get: 
u = 1/(1 + e^(-θT x)). 
Since the given value of σ(θT x) is 1 + e^(-θT x), we can substitute this value into the equation for u: 
u = 1/(1 + (1 + e^(-θT x))). 
Simplifying further, we get: 
u = 1/(2 + e^(-θT x)). 
Thus, the closest integer value of u is 1.
