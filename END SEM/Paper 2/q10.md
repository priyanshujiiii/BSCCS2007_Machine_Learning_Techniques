The model that has the potential to achieve zero training error on every possible training dataset in 2D is:

Decision Tree

A decision tree can easily achieve zero training error on every possible training dataset in 2D because it can split the feature space into regions that are pure (containing only samples of one class) and make decisions based on the feature values in each region. This allows the decision tree to perfectly separate the samples of different classes in the training dataset, resulting in zero training error.

On the other hand, logistic regression, soft margin linear-SVM, and soft margin kernel-SVM with cubic kernel may not be able to achieve zero training error on every possible training dataset in 2D. These models aim to find a decision boundary that can separate the samples of different classes with the least possible error, but they may not always be able to perfectly separate the samples due to the complexity of the decision boundary and the distribution of the data. Hence, these models may have non-zero training error on some training datasets in 2D.
