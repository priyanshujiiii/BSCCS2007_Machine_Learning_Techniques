The activation function used in the hidden layer of a neural network depends on the specific architecture and design choices of the network, and it cannot be determined solely based on the vector output of the hidden layer. 

In the given vector output of the hidden layer, which is [0.1, 0.8, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9], the values fall within the range of 0 to 1, which suggests that the activation function used could be a sigmoid activation function. Sigmoid function maps its input to a range between 0 and 1, and it is commonly used in neural networks for binary classification tasks or when the output needs to be interpreted as a probability.

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is another popular activation function used in neural networks, which maps input values greater than 0 to the same value and input values less than or equal to 0 to 0. ReLU is commonly used in deep neural networks as it helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and speeds up the training process.

Therefore, based on the given vector output of the hidden layer, it is possible that either ReLU or sigmoid activation function could have been used. Hence, the correct answer is "Either ReLU or Sigmoid".
