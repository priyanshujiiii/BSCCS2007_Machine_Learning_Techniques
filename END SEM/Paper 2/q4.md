This is because it includes the original features x1 and x2 as well as their product x1 * x2, which is a common form of feature transformation used in kernel methods. This transformation could be achieved using a kernel function that computes the dot product between the original feature vector [x1, x2] and the transformed feature vector [1, x1, x2, x1 * x2], resulting in a perfect separation of the two classes with a linear classifier.
