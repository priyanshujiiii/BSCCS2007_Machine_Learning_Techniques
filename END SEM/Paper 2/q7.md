The correct answer is: The threshold should be a low value.

Given that the consequences of misclassifying a video with objectionable content as harmless could be severe, it is important to prioritize high sensitivity (true positive rate) in the logistic regression model. A low threshold would result in classifying more videos as belonging to the positive class, including those that might be harmless videos but are classified as objectionable. This may result in some false positives, but it ensures that objectionable videos are not missed, and the priority is given to capturing all videos with objectionable content. Therefore, choosing a low threshold is preferable in this scenario to minimize the risk of false negatives (misclassifying objectionable videos as harmless) and prioritize detection of objectionable content.
