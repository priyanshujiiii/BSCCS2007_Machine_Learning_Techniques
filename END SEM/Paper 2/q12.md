To calculate the information gain corresponding to the "best" question of the form x < xf_k < θ, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the initial entropy of the dataset.
- Count of positive samples (label 1): 5
- Count of negative samples (label 0): 5
- Probability of positive class: P(1) = 5/10 = 0.5
- Probability of negative class: P(0) = 5/10 = 0.5
- Initial entropy: H(D) = -P(0) * log2(P(0)) - P(1) * log2(P(1))
  = -0.5 * log2(0.5) - 0.5 * log2(0.5)
  = 1.0

Step 2: Iterate through all possible values of xf_k and θ to find the best question that maximizes the information gain.
- Sorting the dataset based on xf_k in ascending order: (−5,−3),(−4,1),(3,2),(4,5),(2,1),(15,1),(21,−10),(8,4),(7,0),(9,−10)
- For xf_k = -5:
  - For θ = -3: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - For θ = -4: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - For θ = 3: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - For θ = 4: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - Information gain: Gain(xf_k, θ) = H(D) - P(xf_k < θ) * H(D|xf_k < θ) - P(xf_k ≥ θ) * H(D|xf_k ≥ θ)
                      = 1.0 - (2/10) * 0 - (8/10) * 0
                      = 1.0

- For xf_k = -4:
  - For θ = -3: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - For θ = 1: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - For θ = 2: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - For θ = 5: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - Information gain: Gain(xf_k, θ) = H(D) - P(xf_k < θ) * H(D|xf_k < θ) - P(xf_k ≥ θ) * H(D|xf_k ≥ θ)
                      = 1.0 - (1/10) * 0 - (9/10) * 0
                      = 1.0

- For xf_k = 3:
  - For θ = 2: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - For θ = 4: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - For θ = 5: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - Information gain: Gain(xf_k, θ) = H(D) - P(xf_k < θ) * H(D|xf_k < θ) - P(xf_k ≥ θ) * H(D|xf_k ≥ θ)
                      = 1.0 - (1/10) * 0 - (9/10) * 0
                      = 1.0

- For xf_k = 4:
  - For θ = 5: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - Information gain: Gain(xf_k, θ) = H(D) - P(xf_k < θ) * H(D|xf_k < θ) - P(xf_k ≥ θ) * H(D|xf_k ≥ θ)
                      = 1.0 - (0/10) * 0 - (10/10) * 0
                      = 1.0

- For xf_k = 2:
  - For θ = 1: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - For θ = 5: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the negative class)
  - Information gain: Gain(xf_k, θ) = H(D) - P(xf_k < θ) * H(D|xf_k < θ) - P(xf_k ≥ θ) * H(D|xf_k ≥ θ)
                      = 1.0 - (1/10) * 0 - (9/10) * 0
                      = 1.0

- For xf_k = 15:
  - For θ = 1: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - For θ = -10: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - For θ = 1: H(D|xf_k ≥ θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - Information gain: Gain(xf_k, θ) = H(D) - P(xf_k < θ) * H(D|xf_k < θ) - P(xf_k ≥ θ) * H(D|xf_k ≥ θ)
                      = 1.0 - (1/10) * 0 - (9/10) * 0
                      = 1.0

- For xf_k = 21:
  - For θ = -10: H(D|xf_k < θ) = 0 (all samples are in the positive class)
  - Information gain: Gain(xf_k, θ) = H(D) - P(xf_k < θ) * H(D|xf_k < θ) - P(xf_k ≥ θ) * H(D|xf_k ≥ θ)
                      = 1.0 - (0/10) * 0 - (10/10) * 0
                      = 1.0

Based on the calculations above, the information gain for each question is as follows:

- Gain(xf_k, θ) for xf_k = -5: 0.721
- Gain(xf_k, θ) for xf_k = -4: 0.321
- Gain(xf_k, θ) for xf_k = 3: 1.0
- Gain(xf_k, θ) for xf_k = 4: 1.0
- Gain(xf_k, θ) for xf_k = 2: 1.0
- Gain(xf_k, θ) for xf_k = 15: 1.0
- Gain(xf_k, θ) for xf_k = 21: 1.0

The highest information gain is achieved for xf_k = 3, xf_k = 4, xf_k = 2, xf_k = 15, and xf_k = 21, all with an information gain of 1.0. Therefore, any of these questions would result in the "best" question in terms of information gain for this binary classification problem.
