<p>
  The statement "All the estimators in bagging can be trained parallelly" is true. Bagging is a parallel ensemble method in which multiple base models are trained independently on different subsets of the training data. This means that each base model can be trained on a separate processor or computer, and the results can be aggregated at the end to obtain the final prediction. This makes bagging a highly scalable method that can handle large datasets efficiently.
