<p>
The correct answer is: "It helps in reducing the correlation between the decision trees."

Randomly sampling a subset of features at each node of decision trees in the random forest helps in reducing the correlation between the decision trees, which in turn helps in reducing the overall variance of the model. This is because each decision tree is trained on a different subset of features, so they make different splits at each node. As a result, the trees become less similar and the model becomes less prone to overfitting.
