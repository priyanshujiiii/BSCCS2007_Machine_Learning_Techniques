<p>
  Creating 
�
m different datasets (containing 
�
n examples each) using sampling with replacement from the given dataset is the better choice to create the 
�
m bags for applying the bagging algorithm on the given dataset. This is because the bootstrap sampling with replacement ensures that the samples in each bag are diverse, and it also ensures that each example has an equal chance of being selected in each bag. This randomness helps to reduce overfitting and improve the performance of the ensemble model. On the other hand, splitting the dataset into 
�
m equal sets may lead to bags that are not diverse enough, and this can result in overfitting.
