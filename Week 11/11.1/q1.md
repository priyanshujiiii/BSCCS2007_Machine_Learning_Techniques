<p>
  The correct Lagrangian function corresponding to the soft margin SVM optimization problem is:

L(w,ξ,α,β)= 
1/2||w||^2 +C∑i=1nξi+∑i=1nαi(1−wTx_iyi−ξi)−∑i=1nβiξi,

where w is the weight vector, xi is the ith data point, yi is its corresponding class label (1 or -1), ξi is the slack variable for the ith data point, αi is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the ith data point, βi is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the slack variable ξi, and C is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the number of misclassifications.
