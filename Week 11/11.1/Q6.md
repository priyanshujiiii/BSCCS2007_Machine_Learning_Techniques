False. 

Soft-margin SVM can be kernelized, just like hard-margin SVM. The kernel trick can be used to transform the input space into a higher-dimensional space, allowing for a nonlinear decision boundary to be learned. The soft-margin formulation adds a regularization term to the optimization problem, but it does not change the underlying kernelized formulation.
