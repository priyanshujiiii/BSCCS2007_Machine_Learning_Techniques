<p>
The correct expression that must be satisfied for the optimal solution in the soft margin SVM problem is:

�
�

�
�
�
α
i
​
+β
i
​
=C

This is because the constraints for the soft margin SVM problem are:

0≤α
i
​
≤C
0≤ξ
i
​
≤C

Where C is the constant that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error. The Lagrange multipliers α and β are non-negative, and the slack variables ξ are non-negative and less than or equal to C.

The expression �+�=αi+βi=C ensures that the constraints on αi and βi are satisfied, and that the sum of the Lagrange multipliers is equal to C, which is required for the optimal solution.

The other expressions listed are not necessarily true for the optimal solution, although they may hold in certain cases. Specifically:

�=αi=βi is not necessarily true, as the Lagrange multipliers may take different values for different data points.
0≤�≤1 is not necessarily true, as the Lagrange multipliers may take values greater than 1.
0≤αi≤C is true, but it is not sufficient to ensure the optimal solution. The sum of the Lagrange multipliers must also be equal to C.
