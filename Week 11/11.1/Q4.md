<p>
  The primal variables for the soft margin SVM problem are:

- w: a weight vector that defines the hyperplane separating the classes
- ξ: a vector of slack variables that measures the amount by which a data point violates the margin or is misclassified. The soft margin SVM allows for some misclassifications or violations of the margin, but penalizes them through the use of ξ.
 
The variables α and β are the Lagrange multipliers that are introduced when solving the dual form of the problem.
