  Setting the value of C to zero in the soft-margin SVM means that there is no penalty for misclassifying training examples or violating the margin constraints. This would lead to a very flexible hyperplane that could potentially fit the training data perfectly. However, this may result in overfitting and poor generalization performance on unseen data.

In this case, the optimization problem reduces to a hard-margin SVM, where the goal is to find a hyperplane that perfectly separates the positive and negative examples with the maximum margin. The optimal solution would be:

- The value of $\xi_i$ would be zero for all training examples $(x_i, y_i)$ that are correctly classified by the hyperplane, and non-zero for examples that are misclassified or fall inside the margin region.
- The primal variable $w$ and the Lagrange multipliers $\alpha_i$ would be the same as for the hard-margin SVM, i.e., they would satisfy the KKT conditions for the optimization problem.

Note that with $C=0$, the soft-margin SVM cannot handle any training examples that are not linearly separable, as it does not allow any margin violations. Therefore, this approach is not suitable for datasets with noise or outliers.
