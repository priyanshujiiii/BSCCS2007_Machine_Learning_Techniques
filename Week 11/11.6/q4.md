<p>
  The correct answer is: 

It increases if the weak learners perform well.

In AdaBoost, the number of rounds or weak learners needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy depends on several factors, including the complexity of the problem, the quality of the data, and the performance of the weak learners. In general, if the weak learners are performing well, the number of rounds required to achieve a certain level of accuracy will be lower. On the other hand, if the weak learners are not performing well, more rounds will be needed to achieve the same level of accuracy. In practice, it is common to stop adding weak learners once the performance on a validation set starts to decrease, indicating that the algorithm is starting to overfit.
