False.

It is generally not possible to achieve zero training error in AdaBoost, or any other machine learning algorithm for that matter. The goal of the AdaBoost algorithm is to minimize the classification error on the training data, but it does not guarantee zero error. In fact, trying to achieve zero training error can lead to overfitting, where the algorithm fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new, unseen data. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between minimizing the training error and preventing overfitting.
