<p>
The option "�=1k=1: Overfitting and �=�: k=n: Underfitting" is more likely to happen in k-NN classifier for different values of k.

When k=1, the model will overfit as the decision boundary will be too sensitive to the noise and outliers in the data. On the other hand, when k=n, the model will underfit as it will simply predict the most common class in the dataset, without taking into account the features of the data points. Therefore, the optimal value of k is usually somewhere in between, and finding it involves balancing between bias and variance.
