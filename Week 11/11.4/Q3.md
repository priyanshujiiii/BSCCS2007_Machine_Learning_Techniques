<p>
  Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing data. In general, underfitting models have high bias and low variance. This is because they oversimplify the data and don't have enough flexibility to capture the complexity of the underlying patterns, leading to an inability to fit the training data well. As a result, they will also perform poorly on testing data, indicating high bias. At the same time, because underfitting models are very simple, they also have low variance, which means that they are not very sensitive to changes in the training data.
