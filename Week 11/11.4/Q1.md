<p>
  The term "weak learner" is often used in the context of ensemble learning, such as in the AdaBoost algorithm. A weak learner is a classification algorithm that performs only slightly better than random guessing on a given problem. However, when combined with other weak learners in an ensemble, they can produce a strong learner with much better accuracy. So, the correct answer is: 

The classifiers whose performance is slightly better than the random classifier.
