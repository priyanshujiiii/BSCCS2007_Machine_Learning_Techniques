<p>
  Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data. 

High bias refers to a model that is too simple and has not captured the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and test data. High variance refers to a model that is too complex and has fit the noise in the training data, leading to good performance on the training data but poor performance on the test data.

Therefore, the correct answer is "Less bias and less variance," which indicates a well-fitted model that captures the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting to the noise.
