<p>
  True.

The optimal solution of the primal problem of soft-margin SVM depends on the support vectors, which are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary. The other data points that are further away from the boundary do not affect the optimal solution. Therefore, the optimal solution depends only on a proper subset of the data points, which are the support vectors.
