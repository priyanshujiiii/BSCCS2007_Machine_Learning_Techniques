<p>
  If α_i = C, it means that the i-th training example lies on the margin, and hence, the corresponding slack variable ξ_i = 0. In this case, the i-th training example pays the maximum possible bribe to the classifier.

Therefore, the correct option is:

The i-th data point necessarily pays a positive (>0) bribe.
The other options are not necessarily true, as they depend on the specific characteristics of the optimal solution and the i-th training example. For example, it is possible that the i-th training example is correctly classified by the classifier and lies outside the margin, or that it is correctly classified and lies between the supporting hyperplanes. Additionally, there is no information about the value of β_i when α_i = C.
