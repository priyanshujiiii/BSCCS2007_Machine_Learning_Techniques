  The complementary slackness conditions are as follows:

α_i(1 - y_i(w∗^Tx_i* + b_∗)) = 0 for all i, where b∗ is the optimal bias and x_i is the i-th training example.
This condition implies that either α_i or 1 - y_i(w∗^Tx_i* + b_∗) (or both) must be zero. If α_i is zero, then the i-th training example is not a support vector and has no impact on the solution. If 1 - y_i(w∗^Tx_i* + b_∗) is zero, then the i-th training example is a support vector that lies on the margin or has been misclassified.

β_iξ_i = 0 for all i.
This condition implies that either β_i or ξ_i (or both) must be zero. If β_i is zero, then the i-th training example has no influence on the solution. If ξ_i is zero, then the i-th training example is correctly classified or lies within the margin.

Note that in the first set of conditions, we have used the fact that the optimal w∗ and b∗ satisfy the KKT conditions, which state that:

∇_w*L(w, b, α, β) = 0, where L is the Lagrangian function of the soft-margin SVM problem.
y_i*(w^Tx_i + b) ≥ 1 - ξ_i for all i, where ξ_i* is the slack variable associated with the i-th training example.
α_i ≥ 0 and β_i ≥ 0 for all i.
The second set of conditions follows directly from the fact that α_i and β_i are Lagrange multipliers associated with the primal and dual problems, respectively, and the fact that the primal and dual solutions satisfy the duality constraint:

L(w∗, b∗, α∗, β∗) = d∗,

where d∗ is the optimal value of the dual problem.
