<p>
  If 0 < α_i < C, it means that the i-th training example lies inside the margin and pays a positive bribe to the classifier, but not the maximum possible bribe.

Therefore, the option "The i-th data point pays no bribe" is not correct.

Since the i-th training example lies inside the margin, it is correctly classified by the classifier, but not necessarily on one of the supporting hyperplanes. Therefore, the option "The i-th data point lies on one of the supporting hyperplanes" is not necessarily correct.

Moreover, there is no information about the value of β_i when 0 < α_i < C. Therefore, the options "0 < β_i < C" and "β_i = 0" are also not necessarily correct.

Hence, none of the given options is correct.
