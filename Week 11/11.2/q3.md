<p>
  

If Î±*_i* = 0, it means that the i-th training example is not a support vector and has no impact on the solution. In this case, the classifier is not affected by the i-th training example, and hence, the bribe paid by the i-th training example is equal to 0.

Therefore, the correct option is:

- The bribe paid by the i-th data point is equal to 0.
