<p>
  

If α*_i* = 0, it means that the i-th training example is not a support vector and has no impact on the solution. In this case, the classifier is not affected by the i-th training example, and hence, the bribe paid by the i-th training example is equal to 0.

Therefore, the correct option is:

- The bribe paid by the i-th data point is equal to 0.
  
  
  
  
  The Lagrange multipliers α*_i* and β*_i* in the dual problem are used to represent the importance of each training example in determining the optimal solution. If α*_i* = 0, it means that the i-th training example has no impact on the solution, and hence, the classifier is not affected by the i-th training example. 

In the soft-margin SVM problem, the variable ξ_i* represents the amount by which the i-th training example violates the margin or misclassified. When α*_i* = 0, it means that the i-th training example is correctly classified or lies outside the margin, and hence, ξ*_i* = 0. Therefore, the i-th training example does not pay any bribe, as it does not contribute to the margin violation.

Hence, if α*_i* = 0, the bribe paid by the i-th data point is equal to 0.
