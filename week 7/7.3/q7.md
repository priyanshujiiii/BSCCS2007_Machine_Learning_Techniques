To calculate the impurity of a node in a decision tree using entropy as the measure of impurity, we can use the following formula:

Entropy = - p_1 * log2(p_1) - p_0 * log2(p_0)

where p_1 is the proportion of points with label 1 and p_0 is the proportion of points with label 0 in the node.

Given:
Number of points with label 1: 70
Number of points with label 0: 30

Total number of points in the node: 70 + 30 = 100

p_1 = 70 / 100 = 0.7 (proportion of points with label 1)
p_0 = 30 / 100 = 0.3 (proportion of points with label 0)

Plugging in these values into the entropy formula:

Entropy = - 0.7 * log2(0.7) - 0.3 * log2(0.3)

Calculating the entropy using a calculator or software, we get:

Entropy â‰ˆ 0.88 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the impurity (entropy) of the given node is approximately 0.88.
