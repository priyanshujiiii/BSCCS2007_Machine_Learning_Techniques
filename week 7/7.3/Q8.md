The entropy of a node in a decision tree is maximum when the proportion of points belonging to class 1 (denoted as p) is 0.5 or 50%.

Entropy is a measure of impurity or randomness, and it is maximum when the data is evenly split between the classes. When p = 0.5 or 50%, it means that half of the points in the node belong to class 1 and the other half belong to another class (e.g., class 0 in a binary classification problem). This results in maximum uncertainty or impurity, and hence the maximum entropy.

As p deviates from 0.5 in either direction (i.e., p < 0.5 or p > 0.5), the node's entropy decreases, indicating lower impurity or less uncertainty. This is because the node becomes more biased towards one class as the proportion of points belonging to that class increases or decreases, resulting in lower entropy.

In summary, the node's entropy is maximum when the proportion of points belonging to class 1 (p) is 0.5 or 50%.
