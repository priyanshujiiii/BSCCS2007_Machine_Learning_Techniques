To find the best possible question that can be asked in the form of x ≤ θ for the given binary classification dataset D, where D = {(-1,1), (-3,1), (2,1), (5,0), (3,0), (15,0)}, we need to identify a value of θ that separates the positive class (y=1) from the negative class (y=0) with the maximum margin.

From the given dataset, we can observe that all the points with y=1 are located to the left of points with y=0. Therefore, the best possible question that can be asked is "Is x ≤ θ?" where θ is a threshold value that separates the positive class from the negative class.

Since there are infinitely many correct answers for θ that can separate the classes with the maximum margin, any value of θ that lies between the minimum and maximum x-values of the positive class would be a valid answer. Let's calculate the minimum and maximum x-values of the positive class from the dataset:

Minimum x-value of the positive class: -3
Maximum x-value of the positive class: 2

Therefore, any value of θ that lies between -3 and 2 (inclusive) would be a valid answer. For example, θ can be -3, 0, or 2, among others.
