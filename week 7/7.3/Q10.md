If a question Q1 is "better" than question Q2, it means that the information gain (IG) of Q1 is greater than the information gain of Q2.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

IG(Q1) > IG(Q2)

In other words, if Q1 is a better question than Q2, then the information gain of Q1 is greater than the information gain of Q2. This implies that Q1 provides more discriminatory power or better splits the data into classes compared to Q2. Higher information gain indicates that a question is more effective in reducing uncertainty or impurity in the data, and thus leads to better decision tree splits or better classification performance.
