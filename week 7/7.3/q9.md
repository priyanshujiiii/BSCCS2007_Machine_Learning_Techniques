Given:
Number of points at node Q: 1000
Number of points at node L after split: 250
Number of points at node R after split: 750

The value of γ, which is defined as the cardinality of L divided by the cardinality of Q, can be calculated as follows:

γ = Cardinality of L / Cardinality of Q

γ = 250 / 1000

γ = 0.25

So, the value of γ is 0.25, which indicates that 25% of the points at node Q after the split end up in node L.
