The decision to stop the algorithm at a particular node in a decision tree depends on the impurity or purity of the node, which is typically measured using metrics such as entropy or Gini impurity. A node is considered "pure" if all the points in that node belong to the same class, and "impure" if there are points of multiple classes present.

In the case of a binary classification problem where there are two classes (class 0 and class 1), a node with a proportion of points belonging to class 1 of 0.5 (50%) can be considered as impure, as it contains points from both class 0 and class 1. This is because the proportion of points belonging to class 1 is not 100%, indicating that there are points of other classes as well.

In general, there is no fixed threshold for determining whether a node is "sufficiently pure" to stop the algorithm, as it depends on various factors such as the specific impurity metric used, the problem domain, and the desired level of accuracy or trade-off between accuracy and model complexity. In practice, decision tree algorithms typically continue splitting nodes until they reach a certain threshold of purity or until a predefined maximum depth is reached. This is done to ensure that the resulting decision tree captures the underlying patterns in the data and avoids overfitting.
