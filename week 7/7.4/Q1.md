The shapes of the bounded regions in the decision boundary of a tree node with a question of the form "x ≤ fk ≤ θ" for a classification problem with 2 features can vary, depending on the data and the specific values of fk and θ.

However, in general, the bounded regions can take the following shapes:

1. Rectangular regions: If the question is of the form "x ≤ fk ≤ θ" for both features, the bounded regions can be rectangular in shape, where the decision boundary forms a rectangular region in the feature space.

2. Triangular regions: If the question is of the form "x ≤ fk ≤ θ" for one feature and "x ≤ fk ≤ θ" for the other feature, the bounded regions can be triangular in shape, where the decision boundary forms a triangular region in the feature space.

3. L-shaped regions: If the question is of the form "x ≤ fk ≤ θ" for one feature and "fk ≤ θ" for the other feature, or vice versa, the bounded regions can be L-shaped in shape, where the decision boundary forms an L-shaped region in the feature space.

It's important to note that the exact shape of the bounded regions depends on the specific values of fk and θ, as well as the distribution of the data in the feature space. The shapes of the bounded regions may also change as we move through different levels of the decision tree and encounter different questions and splits.
