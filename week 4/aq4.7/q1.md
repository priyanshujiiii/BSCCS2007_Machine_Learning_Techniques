In a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Jensen's inequality is often used to approximate the log-likelihood function during the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This approximation introduces additional parameters that need to be estimated, known as the "responsibility" or "assignment" probabilities. 

For a GMM with 5 mixtures and a dataset of 100 points, the total number of parameters introduced by Jensen's inequality in the modified log-likelihood can be calculated as follows:

1. Responsibility probabilities: For each data point, we need to estimate the assignment probabilities for each mixture component. Since there are 5 mixtures, we need to estimate 5 assignment probabilities for each data point. So, for a dataset of 100 points, we need to estimate 5 x 100 = 500 assignment probabilities.

Therefore, the total number of parameters introduced by Jensen's inequality in the modified log-likelihood for a GMM with 5 mixtures and a dataset of 100 points is 500.

It's worth noting that the use of Jensen's inequality in the EM algorithm introduces additional computational complexity and can impact the convergence and performance of the algorithm. Alternative methods, such as Variational Inference, can be used to avoid the need for Jensen's inequality and reduce the number of introduced parameters, but they may have their own trade-offs.
