The expression you provided represents the sum of probabilities of a point x_i belonging to each of the three mixture components in a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In GMM, a point x_i is modeled as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions, each associated with a weight or probability (denoted as P(z_i=k)), where k represents the component index.

The expression can be interpreted as the total probability of point x_i belonging to any of the three mixture components, summed over all possible component indices (k=1, 2, 3). In other words, it represents the overall probability of point x_i being generated from the GMM.

Since the probabilities P(z_i=k) are weights associated with each Gaussian component, they represent the contribution or influence of each component in generating the point x_i. The sum of these probabilities for all components (k=1, 2, 3) should be equal to 1, as the point x_i must belong to one of the mixture components with a total probability of 1.

So, the expression 
P(z_i=1) + P(z_i=2) + P(z_i=3)
represents the total probability of point x_i belonging to any of the three mixture components in the GMM, and it should always be equal to 1.
