<h3>We are just using a expression here we are usng gradient descent algprithm. </h3>
<br>
<h3>The main function of the Gradient Descent Algorithm is to minimize the value and the great thing is that  here we are *w </h3>
<br>
<h3>Here Two main question is we havve to understand the purpose </h3>
<br>
<h3># Now we have understand x*x pseudo inverse </h3>
<br>
<h3># where x^T*Y</h3>
