<h3>Hello, this is Bing. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses labeled data to train algorithms that can classify data or predict outcomes accurately12. The labeled data means that each input has a correct output associated with it3. The algorithm learns from the training data and adjusts its weights until it minimizes the error</h2>
