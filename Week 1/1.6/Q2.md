The correct statements are:

1. The vectors in \( B \) are linearly independent.
2. The vectors in \( B \) span \( \mathbb{R}^d \).
3. \( B \) is a basis for \( \mathbb{R}^d \).
4. \( w_i^T w_j = 0 \) for \( i \neq j \).
5. \( w_i^T w_i = 1 \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq d \).

Explanation:

1. The vectors in \( B \) are linearly independent: Since the set of vectors \( B = \{ w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_d \} \) is orthonormal, each vector is orthogonal to the others and has a length of 1. This implies that none of the vectors in \( B \) can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, and hence they are linearly independent.

2. The vectors in \( B \) span \( \mathbb{R}^d \): Since the set of vectors \( B = \{ w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_d \} \) is orthonormal and obtained by running the algorithm for \( d \) rounds on some centered dataset, it is likely that the vectors in \( B \) span the entire \( d \)-dimensional space \( \mathbb{R}^d \).

3. \( B \) is a basis for \( \mathbb{R}^d \): Based on the properties of linearly independent and spanning vectors, it is likely that \( B \) forms a basis for \( \mathbb{R}^d \), which means that any vector in \( \mathbb{R}^d \) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in \( B \).

4. \( w_i^T w_j = 0 \) for \( i \neq j \): Since the vectors in \( B \) are orthonormal, their dot product will be 0 if the indices \( i \) and \( j \) are different, i.e., \( w_i^T w_j = 0 \) for \( i \neq j \).

5. \( w_i^T w_i = 1 \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq d \): Since the vectors in \( B \) are orthonormal, their dot product will be 1 if the indices \( i \) are the same, i.e., \( w_i^T w_i = 1 \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq d \).
