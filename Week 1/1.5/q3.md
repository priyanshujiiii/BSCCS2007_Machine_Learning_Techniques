<h3>
  Explanation:
S1 states that the residue corresponding to every point is perpendicular to the line represented by w. This means that for every point in the dataset, the vector connecting the point to the origin is perpendicular to the line passing through the origin represented by w. This is a valid statement and can be true.

S2 states that all the residues are collinear, meaning they lie on a line passing through the origin. This statement is not necessarily true. Just because the residues are perpendicular to the line represented by w (S1), it does not imply that they are collinear. The points could be scattered in different directions and not necessarily lie on a single line passing through the origin. Therefore, S2 may not be true in general.

Hence, the correct answer is that only S1 is true.
