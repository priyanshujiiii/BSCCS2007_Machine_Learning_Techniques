<p>
  The Hinge loss is convex but not differentiable because it has a sharp corner at zero. Specifically, the Hinge loss function is defined as L(x) = max(0, 1-x), which has a corner point at x=1. At this point, the derivative is not defined since there is no tangent line that can be drawn at this point. Therefore, the Hinge loss is not differentiable at this point. However, it is still a convex function because it is continuous and its second derivative is non-negative. This property makes it useful as a surrogate loss function for the 0-1 loss in optimization problems where convexity is important.
