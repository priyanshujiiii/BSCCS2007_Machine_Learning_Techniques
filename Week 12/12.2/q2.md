  Hinge loss is the best convex approximation of the 0-1 loss. The 0-1 loss function is not convex and not differentiable, making it difficult to optimize. Hinge loss is a convex surrogate loss function that is commonly used in the context of binary classification with SVMs. It is defined as max(0, 1 - yf(x)), where y is the true label, f(x) is the predicted score, and max(0, z) is the max function that returns z if z > 0, and 0 otherwise. Hinge loss penalizes errors that violate the margin between the positive and negative examples, while being more robust to outliers than the 0-1 loss.
