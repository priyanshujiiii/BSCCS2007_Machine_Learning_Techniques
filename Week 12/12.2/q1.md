<p>
  Regularization strength is inversely proportional to the value of C in SVM loss function. 

In SVM, regularization is typically controlled by the hyperparameter C. A smaller value of C leads to a softer margin, allowing more margin violations but potentially resulting in a better generalization performance. In contrast, a larger value of C leads to a hard margin, forcing the model to minimize the training error, but it may result in overfitting. Therefore, a larger C value means stronger regularization and a smaller C value means weaker regularization.
