  False. While hinge loss is a good surrogate function for the 0-1 loss, it is not exactly the same. The hinge loss produces a continuous and convex function that can be optimized using efficient algorithms, but it allows some margin of error by penalizing only the examples that are classified incorrectly and lie within a certain margin of the decision boundary. In contrast, the 0-1 loss is a non-convex function that is not amenable to optimization and penalizes all misclassifications equally.
