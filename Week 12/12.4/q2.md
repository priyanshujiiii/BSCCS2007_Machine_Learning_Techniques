<p>
  The input layer will have 10 neurons (one for each feature), and the output layer will have 1 neuron (to output the predicted continuous value in regression). So the answer is: 

10, 1
  
  For a regression problem, the input layer will have as many neurons as the number of features in the dataset, which is 10 in this case. The output layer will have a single neuron, which will give the predicted continuous output value for the given input features. Therefore, the correct option is (10, 1).
