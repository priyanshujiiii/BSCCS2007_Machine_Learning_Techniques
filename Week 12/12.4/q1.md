  False. 

The loss function of a neural network is not necessarily a convex function. In fact, it is typically a non-convex function, which means that there can be multiple local minima in the loss function. This makes optimization of the neural network more challenging, as the optimization algorithm can converge to a suboptimal solution if it gets stuck in a local minimum. However, even though the loss function is not convex, it can still be optimized using gradient-based methods such as stochastic gradient descent.
