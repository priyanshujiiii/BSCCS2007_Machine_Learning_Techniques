The function h(x) maps an input vector x in Rd to +1 or -1 based on the sign of the dot product between w and x. The dot product wTx is equivalent to (wTx)*y where y is either +1 or -1, depending on the true label of x. Therefore, we can rewrite the condition h(x) ≠ y as:

h(x) ≠ y  ⟺  sign(wTx) ≠ y  ⟺  (wTx)*y < 0

Similarly, we can rewrite the condition h(x) = y as:

h(x) = y  ⟺  sign(wTx) = y  ⟺  (wTx)*y > 0

Therefore, we can see that the following options are equivalent to 1(h(x) ≠ y):

- 1((wTx)*y ≥ 0)
- 1((wTx)*y < 0)

Option 2 is the correct answer.
