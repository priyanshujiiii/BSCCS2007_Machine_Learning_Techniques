#This code loads the breast cancer dataset, splits the data into training and testing sets, performs PCA with 10 components on the training data, trains a logistic regression classifier on the reduced dimensionality data, makes predictions on the testing data, and evaluates the accuracy of the classifier. The PCA class from scikit-learn is used to perform the PCA, and the fit_transform method is used to transform the training data, while the transform method is used to transform the testing data using the learned transformation from the training data.
#You can modify this code to work with other datasets, use a different number of principal components, and use a different machine learning algorithm as needed.
