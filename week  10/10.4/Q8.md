<p>
  Solving the dual problem using gradient-based techniques is computationally more advantageous when
�
n≫d, which means when the number of data points is much larger than the number of features. In this case, the primal problem has a large number of variables, and solving it would require a lot of computational resources. However, the dual problem has a smaller number of variables, and hence, can be solved more efficiently using gradient-based techniques.
