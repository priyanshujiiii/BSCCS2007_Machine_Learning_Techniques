<p>

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct, the statement is true.

For a given α, the optimal wα* is a linear combination of the data points, where the coefficients of the linear combination are given by αiyi, where yi is the label of the i-th data point. This is because the Lagrangian function involves the inner product between the weight vector w and the data points xi multiplied by their labels yi. When we take the derivative of the Lagrangian function with respect to w, we get the condition that w must be a linear combination of the data points with coefficients given by αiyi.
