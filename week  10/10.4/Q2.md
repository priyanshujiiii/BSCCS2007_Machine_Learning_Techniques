<p>
Option 1 is equivalent to the given formulation.

The given problem can be expressed in the Lagrangian form as:

L(w,α) = 1/2 ||w||^2 - ∑αi[(wTx_i)y_i - 1]

where αi is the Lagrange multiplier for the i-th constraint.

To convert this into the dual problem, we need to find the minimum of L(w,α) with respect to w, which is obtained by setting the derivative of L with respect to w to zero:

∇w L(w,α) = w - ∑αiy_ix_i = 0

Therefore, w = ∑αiy_ix_i.

Substituting this value of w back into the Lagrangian, we get:

L(α) = ∑αi - 1/2 ∑∑αiαjyiyj(x_i^Tx_j)

The dual problem is to maximize L(α) subject to the constraints αi ≥ 0 for all i.

Option 1 can be obtained by directly substituting the value of w into the primal problem and eliminating the w variable. The resulting problem is:

min 1/2 ∑∑αiαjyiyj(x_i^Tx_j) - ∑αi

subject to ∑αiy_i = 0 and αi ≥ 0 for all i.

This is equivalent to the option 1 given in the question.
