<p>
  The reason why S1 is true and S2 is false is because of the definition of convexity.

A function is said to be convex if its second derivative is non-negative. For a function of multiple variables, like the convex function in S1, the Hessian matrix (matrix of second-order partial derivatives) must be positive semi-definite for the function to be convex. The Hessian of f(w) = w^T w is simply the 2x2 identity matrix, which is positive semi-definite. Therefore, S1 is true.

On the other hand, the function in S2 is not convex. The function 1-(w^T x_i)y_i is a linear combination of a convex function and a concave function, and as such, it is neither convex nor concave. The easiest way to see this is to consider the one-dimensional case, where x_i and y_i are scalars. In this case, the function reduces to 1 - (w x_i)y_i, which is the sum of a linear function (1) and a concave function (-w x_i y_i). Since it is neither convex nor concave, S2 is false.
