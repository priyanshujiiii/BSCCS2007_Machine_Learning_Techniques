<p>
  The first statement is true. The optimal α∗ encodes the importance of the ith data-point in forming the weight vector.

The second statement is not necessarily true. The optimal α∗ can be zero for some data points. This happens when the corresponding data points are not support vectors.

The third statement is true. The optimal α∗ is non-negative for all i because of the constraint that αi ≥ 0 for all i.
