<p>
Show that the objective function of the dual has the form:

maximize 1 - (1/2) * α^T (Y^T X^T XY) α


subject to 0 <= α_i <= C for i = 1, ..., n
sum(α_i * y_i) = 0 for i = 1, ..., n



Where 
- X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]^T is the data matrix, with each row representing a data point
- Y = diag(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n) is a diagonal matrix with entries y_i, y_i is the label of the i-th data point
- C > 0 is a constant
- α is a vector of Lagrange multipliers

Proof:

The primal problem is:

minimize 1/2 * w^T w + C * sum(ξ_i)


subject to y_i(w^T x_i + b) >= 1 - ξ_i for i = 1, ..., n
ξ_i >= 0 for i = 1, ..., n

The Lagrangian is:

L(w, b, ξ, α, µ) = 1/2 * w^T w + C * sum(ξ_i) - sum(α_i * (y_i(w^T x_i + b) - 1 + ξ_i)) - sum(µ_i * ξ_i)



Taking the derivatives with respect to w, b, and ξ_i, and setting them to zero, we get:

w = sum(α_i * y_i * x_i)

sum(α_i * y_i) = 0

α_i = C - µ_i for i = 1, ..., n

Substituting these back into the Lagrangian, we get the dual problem:

maximize -1/2 * sum_i(sum_j(α_i * α_j * y_i * y_j * x_i^T x_j)) + sum_i(α_i)

subject to 0 <= α_i <= C for i = 1, ..., n
sum(α_i * y_i) = 0 for i = 1, ..., n


This can be reformulated as:

maximize 1 - (1/2) * α^T (Y^T X^T XY) α

subject to 0 <= α_i <= C for i = 1, ..., n
sum(α_i * y_i) = 0 for i = 1, ..., n



where X^T is the transpose of the data matrix X, Y is a diagonal matrix with entries y_i, and XY = X^T Y X. Therefore, the matrix Y^T X^T XY is a symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix with dimensions n x n.
