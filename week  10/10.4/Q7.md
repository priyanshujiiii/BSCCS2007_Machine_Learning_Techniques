<p>
The dimensionality of the space over which you are searching in the case of the primal and dual problems depends on the number of variables in the respective problems.

For the primal problem, we are trying to find the values of the weights w that minimize the objective function. The dimensionality of the space over which we are searching is the same as the number of weights, which is d.

For the dual problem, we are trying to find the values of the dual variables Î± that maximize the objective function. The dimensionality of the space over which we are searching is the same as the number of constraints, which is n.
