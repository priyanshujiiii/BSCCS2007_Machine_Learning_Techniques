<p>
  The two classifiers will have equal width. The width of the hyperplane is proportional to the distance between the two parallel hyperplanes that define the margin, which is given by
2/‖w‖. Since ‖w1‖ > ‖w2‖, the width of the margin for the first classifier will be smaller than the width of the margin for the second classifier. However, the width of the margin is normalized by ‖w‖, so both classifiers will have the same width.
