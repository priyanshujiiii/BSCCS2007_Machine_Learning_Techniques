<p>
  (a) is true because the equation
�
�
�
0
w
T
x=0 can be rearranged to
w
T
x+b=0, which is the equation of a hyperplane passing through the origin if b=0.

(b) is true because if we add or subtract a constant from the equation
�
�
�
0
w
T
x=0, we obtain an equation of a hyperplane parallel to the original equation. Specifically, adding γ to both sides gives
�

w
T
x=γ.

(c) is true because scaling the weight vector w by a factor of 2 scales the distance from the hyperplane to the origin by a factor of 2, so the equation
