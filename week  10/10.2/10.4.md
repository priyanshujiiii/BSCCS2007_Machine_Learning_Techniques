<p>
The distance between the two bounding planes can be calculated as twice the distance from the origin to either plane, which can be computed as follows:

For the plane
�
�
�
−
1
w
T
x=−1, the distance from the origin can be found by taking the dot product of the plane's normal vector (which is
�
w
normalized) with the point
(
1
2
,
0
)
T
on the plane, as follows:

d
1
(
�
w
/
∥
w
∥
)
T
(
1
2
0
)
(
1
2
−
1
3
)
T
(
1
2
0
)
1
2
⋅
1

(−
1
3
)
⋅
0
1
2

Similarly, for the plane
�
�
�
1
w
T
x=1, the distance from the origin can be found by taking the dot product of the plane's normal vector (which is
�
w
normalized) with the point
(
−
1
2
,
0
)
T
on the plane, as follows:

d
2
(
�
w
/
∥
w

)
T
(
−
1
2
0
)
(
1
2
−
1
3
)
T
(
−

2
0
)
−
1
2
⋅
1

(−

3
)
⋅
0
−

2

Therefore, the width of the margin is:

d

−
d

−

−

−

So the width of the margin is 1 unit.
