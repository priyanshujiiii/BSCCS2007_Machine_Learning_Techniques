  The optimal value of γ is the one that corresponds to the maximum margin classifier. Therefore, the correct answer is (1).
  
  Yes, that is correct. The optimal value of γ is infinite because the objective is to maximize γ subject to the constraint that all data points lie at least γ units away from the decision boundary. If the data is linearly separable, then there is always a solution with γ greater than or equal to the distance of the closest point to the decision boundary. As the distance to the closest point can be arbitrarily small, γ can be arbitrarily large, hence the optimal value of γ is infinite.
