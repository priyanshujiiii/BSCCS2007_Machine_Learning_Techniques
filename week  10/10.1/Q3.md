<p>True.

The perceptron algorithm updates the weight vector in such a way that it tries to find a decision boundary that correctly classifies all the training examples. If the training data is linearly separable, then there are multiple possible decision boundaries that can correctly classify the data. The weight vector that corresponds to the decision boundary with the largest margin is one such solution.

Therefore, if the dataset is linearly separable, the weight vector output by the perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to correspond to a decision boundary with a maximum margin, as it correctly classifies all the training examples and maximizes the distance between the decision boundary and the closest data point from either class.
