<p>
  As mentioned in the previous answer, in the first run of the perceptron algorithm, it is possible that the algorithm makes zero mistakes. However, in the worst-case scenario, it may make up to 400 mistakes since there are 400 data points in total. This is because the perceptron algorithm updates the weight vector each time it misclassifies a point, and it may take up to 400 updates to find a weight vector that correctly classifies all the points.

In the second run of the perceptron algorithm, if the weight vector found in the first run correctly classifies all the points, the perceptron algorithm will not make any mistakes. However, if the weight vector found in the first run does not correctly classify all the points, the perceptron algorithm may make mistakes until it converges to a weight vector that does. Since there are only 16 data points that lie on the boundary of the ball with radius 20, the worst-case scenario is that the perceptron algorithm makes up to 16 mistakes in the second run.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the first perceptron makes at most 400 mistakes while the second one makes at most 16 mistakes.
