<p>
  The soft-margin SVM adds slack variables 
�
ξ
i
ξi for each data point, allowing some misclassification. Therefore, the soft-margin SVM has 
2
d
+ 
n
n+1
constraints, where 
d
d is the dimensionality of the data and 
n
n is the number of data points.

For a dataset with 
100
100 data points, let's assume the dimensionality of the data is 
10
10 (just as an example). Then, the number of constraints would be:

2
×
10
+ 
100
100+1
= 
20
202
= 
10
101
So the soft-margin SVM for this dataset would have 
10
101
constraints.
