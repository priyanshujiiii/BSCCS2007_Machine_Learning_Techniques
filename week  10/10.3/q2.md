<p>
  The Lagrangian function for this optimization problem is:

L(w, α) = w1^2 - 3w2 + α(5 - w1 - 7w2)

where α is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the inequality constraint.

If we evaluate the Lagrangian function at w' = [w1', w2'] and use the given relationship, we get:

w1' + 7w2' > 5

Substituting this inequality into the constraint, we get:

w1'^2 - 3w2' ≤ w1'^2 - 3w2' + (5 - w1' - 7w2')

= α(5 - w1' - 7w2')

Since 5 - w1' - 7w2' is negative according to the given relationship, α must also be negative to satisfy the inequality constraint. Therefore, the output of the expression is negative.
