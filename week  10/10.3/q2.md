The expression "max ≥0 α≥0 max L(w′,α)" represents a maximization problem with respect to both w and α, where α is a vector of Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints of the optimization problem. 

The Lagrangian function for this optimization problem can be defined as:

L(w, α) = L(w1, w2, α1, α2) = f(w1, w2) + α1(g1(w1, w2) - 5) + α2(g2(w1, w2) - 5)

where f(w1, w2) = ½ w1^2 - 3w2^2, g1(w1, w2) = w1 + 7w2, and g2(w1, w2) = -w1 + 7w2.

Given that the relationship g1(w1', w2') > 5 and g2(w1', w2') > 5 holds for the fixed values of w' = [w1', w2'] and the variable values α ≥ 0, it implies that the constraints are not active, i.e., they are not binding at the optimal solution. 

In such a case, the Lagrange multipliers associated with these constraints will be zero, i.e., α1 = α2 = 0, and the Lagrangian function L(w', α) evaluated at w' will only include the objective function f(w', w2'):

L(w', α) = f(w1', w2') = ½ w1'^2 - 3w2'^2

Therefore, the output of the expression "max ≥0 α≥0 max L(w′,α)" would simply be equal to f(w1', w2') without any constraints or Lagrange multipliers, which is ½ w1'^2 - 3w2'^2.
