<p>
The statement is true.

In the case of multiple constraints, the Lagrangian function is defined as:

L(w,
�
α)=f(w)+
i=1
∑
n
​
α
i
​
g
i
​
(w)

where
�
α
i
​
is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the
i
-th constraint
g
i
​
(w).

For the Lagrangian to be a valid dual function, the multiplier
�
α
i
​
corresponding to each constraint should be greater than or equal to zero. This is because if
�
α
i
​
is negative, then increasing the value of
�
α
i
​
would decrease the value of the Lagrangian, making it unbounded below. Therefore, to obtain a valid dual function, the multiplier
�
α
i
​
should be non-negative.
