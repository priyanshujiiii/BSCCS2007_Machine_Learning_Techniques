The Lagrangian for the given optimization problem with $n$ constraints is:

L(w,α)=f(w)+∑ 
i=1

 g

 (w)

where $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n)$ is the vector of Lagrange multipliers, and $g_i(w)$ are the constraint functions.

Note that in the Lagrangian, the constraint functions $g_i(w)$ are multiplied by their respective Lagrange multipliers $\alpha_i$, which reflects the fact that the Lagrange multipliers are the variables that capture the trade-off between optimizing the objective function and satisfying the constraints.
