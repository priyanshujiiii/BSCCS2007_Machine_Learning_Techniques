  If the point w' lies strictly in the interior of the circle, then the inequality constraint is active (i.e., w1^2 + w2^2 = 1), so we can rewrite the Lagrangian function as:

L(w, α) = w1^2 - 3w2 + α(5 - w1 - 7w2 + w1^2 + w2^2 - 1)

= (1 + α)w1^2 + (-7α + 1)w2^2 + (-αw1 - 7αw2 + 5)

To find the value of α that maximizes the Lagrangian, we need to differentiate it with respect to α and set the derivative equal to zero:

∂L/∂α = -w1 - 7w2 + 6α - 5 = 0

Substituting w1 = w1' and w2 = w2' into this equation and solving for α, we get:

α = (w1' + 7w2' - 5) / 6

Therefore, the value of α that maximizes the Lagrangian is (w1' + 7w2' - 5) / 6.
