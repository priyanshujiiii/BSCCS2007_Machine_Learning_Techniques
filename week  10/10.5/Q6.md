<p>
The expression can be simplified using the complementary slackness condition for SVMs. For any data point i, we have:

α
i
∗
(y
i
(w
∗

T
x
i
​
)−1) = 0

If a data point i is not a support vector, then α
i
∗
= 0. If a data point i is a support vector, then (y
i
(w
∗

T
x
i
​
)−1) = 0, which implies that y
i
(w
∗

T
x
i
​
) > 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

∑

∈

∗
i∈M
∑
​
α
i

​
= ∑

M
α

∗
Since the sum is taken over all the support vectors, the value of the expression is equal to the sum of the Lagrange multipliers for the support vectors.
