<p>
In the context of SVMs, the statement that is true is:

(w∗)Tx_i = y_i,

where x_i is the i-th data-point and y_i is its corresponding label (+1 or -1). This equation is known as the complementary slackness condition and it represents the fact that only support vectors have non-zero alpha values. Since alpha_i^* > 0 for the i-th data-point, it is a support vector and its corresponding Lagrange multiplier is used in the computation of the optimal weight vector w*. Therefore, (w∗)Tx_i = y_i is satisfied for all support vectors.
