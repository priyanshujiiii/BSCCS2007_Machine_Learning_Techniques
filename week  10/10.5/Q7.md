T
x=1 is the region bounded by these two planes, and any point lying strictly between them is considered to be inside this region.

Let's consider the dot product of a point
x
with the weight vector
w
∗
:

(

​

If a point lies between the two supporting planes, then its dot product with the weight vector lies between -1 and 1:

−1<w
∗

T
x<1

This condition can be rewritten as:

−1<∑
i
α
i
y
i

​
<1

Therefore, a point lies between the two supporting planes if and only if:

∑
i
α
i
y
i
x
i

​
lies between -1 and 1.

Thus, the number of points that lie in the region between the two supporting planes is equal to the number of points
x
for which:

−1<∑
i
α
i
y
i
x
i
x
​
<1

Therefore, we need to count the number of
x
for which:

−1<∑
i
α
i
y
i
x
i
x
​
<1

This can be done by looping over all data points
x
and checking the above condition. Any point that satisfies the condition is counted as lying between the two supporting planes.
