<p>
The correct option is:

The optimal value of the objective function is
�
(
�
∗
)
f(w
∗
)

Explanation:

The primal problem is a nested optimization problem where the outer objective is to minimize a sum of two functions, one being the maximum of another function over a non-negative domain. The dual of this problem can be derived using the Lagrangian duality technique.

Given that
�
∗
w
∗
is the primal solution, we can find the optimal value of the objective function by substituting the primal solution into the objective function.

The objective function of the primal problem can be written as:

f(w) + max
�
≥ 0
αg(w)

Substituting the primal solution w
∗
, we get:

f(w
∗
) + max
�
≥ 0
αg(w
∗
)

Since the maximum value of
αg(w
∗
) over the non-negative domain is given by the dual solution
α
∗
, we have:

f(w
∗
) +
�
�
∗
α
∗
g(w
∗
)

Therefore, the optimal value of the objective function is
�
(
�
∗
)
f(w
∗
) +
�
�
∗
α
∗
g(w
∗
), which is only dependent on the primal solution w
∗
and the dual solution
α
∗
.

Hence, option (a) is the correct answer.
