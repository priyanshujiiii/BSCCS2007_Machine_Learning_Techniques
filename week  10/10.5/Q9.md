<p>
  The predicted label for a test-point x_test using a kernel-SVM with optimal solution alpha* is:

sign(
âˆ‘ 
i=1 to n (alpha*i*yi*k(xi,x_test))
)

Here, k(xi,x_test) is the kernel function evaluated at xi and x_test. The sign function returns +1 for a positive value and -1 for a negative value. Therefore, the predicted label is determined by the sign of the weighted sum of kernel evaluations.
