The correct statements concerning the given optimization problem are:

- $(\hat{w}) = \min_{w} \ L(w, \hat{\alpha}) = f(w^*)$, where $\hat{w}$ is the optimal value of $w$ for the optimization problem.
- $L(w^*, \hat{\alpha}) = f(w^*) + \hat{\alpha} g(w^*)$.
- $w^*$ is a primal solution.
- $\nabla_w L(w^*, \hat{\alpha}) \mid_{w=w^*} = 0$.
