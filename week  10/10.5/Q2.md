The correct option is:

The optimal value of the objective function is
min
⁡
�

�
(
�
)

�
∗
�
(
�
)
w
min
​
f(w)+α
∗
g(w)

Explanation:

For the dual problem, the optimal value of the objective function is given by:

max
⁡
�
≥
0

[
min
⁡
�

f(w)+αg(w)
]
Now, using the fact that
�
f(w)+αg(w) is a convex function with respect to
�
w for fixed
�
α, we can apply the strong duality theorem to obtain the primal objective function in terms of the dual solution.

The strong duality theorem tells us that the optimal value of the primal problem is equal to the optimal value of the dual problem, i.e.,

min
⁡
�

[
max
⁡
�
≥
0

�
(
�
)

�
�
(
�
)
]
w
min
​
[
α≥0
max
​
f(w)+αg(w)] = max
⁡
�
≥
0

[
min
⁡
�

f(w)+αg(w)
]
Thus, the optimal value of the primal objective function is given by:

�
(
�
∗
)
max
⁡
�
≥
0

[
min
⁡
�

f(w)+αg(w)
]
Now, to evaluate this expression, we need to find the optimal
�
w for a fixed value of
�
α.

The optimal
�
w is given by:

w
∗
∑
�
1
�
�
�
∗
�
�
�
�
x
i
y
i
α
i
∗
​
where
�
i=1,2,⋯,n

Substituting this expression for
�
w in the primal objective function, we get:

�
(
�
∗
)
f(
∑
�
1
�
�
�
∗
�
�
�
�
x
i
y
i
α
i
∗
​
) + α
∗
g(
∑
�
1
�
�
�
∗
�
�
�
�
x
i
y
i
α
i
∗
​
)
Now, we can see that the term
�
f(
∑
�
1
�
�
�
∗
�
�
�
�
x
i
y
i
α
i
∗
​
) is the primal objective function evaluated at
�
w
∗
, which is a fixed value. Similarly,
�
g(
∑
�
1
�
�
�
∗
�
�
�
�
x
i
y
i
α
i
∗
​
) is also a fixed value. Therefore, the optimal value of the objective function is given by:

�
(
�
∗
)
f(
∑
�
1
�
�
�
∗
�
�
�
�
x
i
y
i
α
i
∗
​
)
