  True. 

Kernel-SVMs can be used to overcome the problem of outliers in a dataset that is otherwise linearly separable. By using a kernel function to transform the input space into a higher-dimensional feature space, the kernel-SVM can find a nonlinear decision boundary that separates the classes in the transformed feature space. This can help to overcome the influence of outliers, as the kernel-SVM can find a decision boundary that is not affected by a small number of outliers in the input space.
