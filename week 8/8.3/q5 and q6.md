For the given binary classification problem with 4 binary features and uniform(0,1) distributed labels, and the provided training dataset with labels [0, 1, 1, 0], the probability that the first feature of a point takes the value 0 given that the point is labeled 0 can be calculated as follows:

1. Count the number of points labeled 0 in the training dataset: 2 points
2. Count the number of points labeled 0 in the training dataset where the first feature takes the value 0: 1 point
3. Calculate the probability using the counts from step 2 divided by the counts from step 1:

Probability of the first feature being 0 given that the point is labeled 0:

P(First feature=0 | Label=0) = Number of points labeled 0 with first feature=0 / Number of points labeled 0

P(First feature=0 | Label=0) = 1 / 2 = 0.5

So, the probability that the first feature of a point takes the value 0 given that the point is labeled 0 is 0.5.

Now, for the naive Bayes algorithm, we can use the calculated probabilities to make a prediction for the point [1, 0, 1, 0]. The naive Bayes algorithm assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the label, and calculates the probability of each label given the features using Bayes' theorem.

1. Calculate the probability of the point [1, 0, 1, 0] belonging to class 0:

P(Label=0 | Features=[1, 0, 1, 0]) = P(Features=[1, 0, 1, 0] | Label=0) * P(Label=0)

2. Calculate the probability of the point [1, 0, 1, 0] belonging to class 1:

P(Label=1 | Features=[1, 0, 1, 0]) = P(Features=[1, 0, 1, 0] | Label=1) * P(Label=1)

3. Compare the probabilities calculated in step 1 and step 2, and assign the class with the higher probability as the predicted label for the point [1, 0, 1, 0].

Since the naive condition holds true, the conditional probabilities P(Features | Label) can be calculated by considering the individual feature probabilities.

Based on the provided training dataset, the individual feature probabilities for class 0 and class 1 are as follows:

P(Feature=0 | Label=0) = 0.25 (1 out of 4 points labeled 0 has the first feature as 0)
P(Feature=1 | Label=0) = 0.75 (3 out of 4 points labeled 0 have the first feature as 1)
P(Feature=0 | Label=1) = 0.5 (1 out of 2 points labeled 1 has the first feature as 0)
P(Feature=1 | Label=1) = 0.5 (1 out of 2 points labeled 1 has the first feature as 1)

Assuming that the prior probabilities P(Label=0) and P(Label=1) are both 0.5 (uniform distribution), we can calculate the probabilities of the point [1, 0, 1, 0] belonging to class 0 and class 1 using the naive Bayes algorithm:

P(Label=0 | Features=[1, 0, 1, 0]) = P(Feature=1 | Label=0) * P(Feature=0
