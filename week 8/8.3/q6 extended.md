To make a prediction (label 0 or 1) for the point [1, 0, 1, 0] using the naive Bayes algorithm with the given training dataset and probabilities, we can calculate the conditional probabilities for each class (0 and 1) and choose the class with the higher probability as the predicted label for the point.

Based on the individual feature probabilities and assuming uniform prior probabilities for both classes (P(Label=0) = P(Label=1) = 0.5), we can calculate the conditional probabilities for class 0 and class 1:

For class 0:
P(Feature=0 | Label=0) = 0.25
P(Feature=1 | Label=0) = 0.75

P(Label=0 | Features=[1, 0, 1, 0]) = P(Feature=1 | Label=0) * P(Feature=0 | Label=0) * P(Label=0)
= 0.75 * 0.25 * 0.5
= 0.09375

For class 1:
P(Feature=0 | Label=1) = 0.5
P(Feature=1 | Label=1) = 0.5

P(Label=1 | Features=[1, 0, 1, 0]) = P(Feature=1 | Label=1) * P(Feature=0 | Label=1) * P(Label=1)
= 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5
= 0.125

Since the probability of class 1 (0.125) is higher than the probability of class 0 (0.09375), the naive Bayes algorithm would predict the label 1 for the point [1, 0, 1, 0].
